/**

 * When the device is plugged in, this reports what's actually useful — the estimated charging speed
 * and whether it's wired or wireless — rather than the old, often-misleading "AC charger connected"
 * message (issue #122). The AC/USB distinction was dropped because {@code EXTRA_PLUGGED} reports
 * {@code BATTERY_PLUGGED_AC} for many power banks and fast chargers, so it couldn't be trusted; the
 * wired/wireless split, by contrast, is reliable.
 * <p>
 * Charging current reads 0 or noisy for a moment right at plug-in, so the speed is sampled a short
 * delay after connection (see {@link #CHARGE_SAMPLE_DELAY_MS}) rather than synchronously here. The
 * foreground {@code PowerConnectionService} keeps the process alive across that delay.
